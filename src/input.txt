Neeraj Deewan of Quantum Securities told CNBC-TV18, Management commentary from ICICI Bank   that we have heard now and extra provisioning that they have done in the books, I think now according to what is visible is that pain should be over for this stock for at least the immediate term. If there is no more further bad news coming in, I think this is a good price to buy into ICICI Bank.
