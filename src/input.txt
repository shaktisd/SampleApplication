Hercules Offshore (HERO) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last August as the crash in oil prices began to send financial stress rippling through the oil and gas world.
The oil services company emerged from bankruptcy seemingly a healthier entity in November after shedding $1.2 billion of debt. But then a second wave of turmoil hit the oil industry as crude plunged to 13-year lows in February.
That's why Hercules Offshore announced on Friday it plans to once again file for Chapter 11 in an effort to sell off assets. Shares of the Houston company plunged 39% on the news.
Hercules said it will file motions with the court to allow the company to continue paying suppliers and maintain employee wages and benefits.
Once it becomes official, Hercules would be the first oil company during the current downturn to become a so-called "Chapter 22" by going bankrupt twice, bankruptcy lawyers said.
